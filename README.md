# Vehicle Movement System 🚗✈️🚢

A Python OOP demonstration showing inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation with different vehicle types.

## Features
- **4 Vehicle Types**: Car, Airplane, Boat, Motorcycle
- **OOP Principles**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
- **Unique Movement**: Each vehicle moves differently
- **Vehicle-Specific Actions**: Gear changes, takeoff, anchor control, kickstand

## Classes
- `Vehicle` (Base class)
- `Car` - Drives on roads 🚗
- `Airplane` - Flies in sky ✈️  
- `Boat` - Sails on water 🚢
- `Motorcycle` - Rides on streets 🏍️

## Usage
```python
python vehicles.py
```
Watch each vehicle start, prepare, move in its unique way, and stop!

## OOP Concepts
- **Inheritance**: All vehicles extend base Vehicle class
- **Polymorphism**: Each implements `move()` differently
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with getter methods
